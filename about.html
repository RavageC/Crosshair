          My name is Callum and I've been building this browser extension whilst
          I've been learning JavaScript. This seemed like a great starting
          project and something that I believed would be useful for anyone who
          plays any of the Spot The Ball competitions featured on botb.com.<br />
          <br />
          If you've found this tool helpful, I'd first like to thank you for
          taking the time to evaluate this browser extension. You may make a
          donation to my Paypal below, but please don't feel you have to. I didn't do
          this for financial gain but for my enjoyment of problem solving. This
          tool enhances my experience when using BOTB and I hope it will do the
          same for others who discover it.<br />
          <br />
          <!--Not a current player of BOTB? I have an affiliate link you can use to
          sign up.-->Be aware that botb.com, while it constitutes a skill based
          game, it does share similarities to gambling and so you should play
          within your means.<br />
