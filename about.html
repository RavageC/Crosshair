      My name is Callum and I've been building this browser extension whilst
      I've been learning JavaScript. This seemed like a great starting project
      and something that I believed would be useful for anyone who plays any of
      the Spot The Ball competitions featured on botb.com.<br />
      <br />
      If you've found this tool helpful, I'd first like to thank you for taking
      the time to evaluate this browser extension. You may make a donation to my
      PayPal, but please don't feel you have to. I didn't do this for financial
      gain but for my enjoyment of problem solving. This tool enhances my
      experience when using BOTB and I hope it will do the same for others who
      discover it.<br />
      <br />
