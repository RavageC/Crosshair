Font downloaded from https://www.dafont.com/lt-wave.font & https://lyonstype.wixsite.com/home/wave. A huge thanks to LyonsType for making this available.

Note from the font author:
"LyonsType gives a warm welcome to a futuristic typeface named "Wave" - which makes a quality resemblance with synthwave, retrowave and other 80's elements. The design of this font pays a reference to the logotype of the 20 years defunct ISP from the UK called "Freeserve", however it is uncertain whether or not there was an actual bespoke typeface made solely for it. But on the other hand, the typeface also can be used for any bespoke elements such as sports, headlines, user interfaces, digital, and so on - as well as for YouTube videos and any online content. LT Wave consists of the following families:

Light
Light Italic
Regular
Italic
Bold
Bold Italic
UI [User Interface]
Mono

Enjoy your use of "Wave" from LyonsType."
