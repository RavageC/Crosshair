Features to incorporate:

// SET TIME ASIDE TO ADD TO THIS LIST //
// UPDATE: Think this list is long enough for now... //

priority 1: configure the appearance of the extension

2: visual indication of your average coord on screen on the picture

3: display average coord numbers on screen (Further enhance this by using the BOTB target zone image)

4: Type in a coord and press the place button to place it

4.5: Remove magnifier completely

5: Remove all Coords (clear all) - Definitely will need an "Are you sure?" prompt

6: Draw shapes on the image (could enhance this further by providing the user number of coords inside the square)

7: togglable gridlines in the magnified area (or just the ability to snap between coords)

8: a football overlay on the magnifying area that's togglable (Could be further customised by adding a few different looking footballs)
 
9: the ability to hide visibility of coords already placed so you can draw lines again without any bias.

10: Play with the full 4k image (Assume this would have to be zoomed in on most people's screens, but people with 4k screens could play it full

- A way of playing botb with other players (Need to break down the how, but would like to recreate the botb judge experience for normal players)
